# devconf.cz-edge-automation

This is the repository for the "Driving Edge Automation with Events" DevConf.cz session!

If you want to replicate the scenario, ensure your *kubeconfig* replaces the default one.

To install required manifests, just run the **configure-demo.sh** script, it will take care of creating all necessary resources.

    git clone https://github.com/kubealex/devconf.cz-edge-automation.git
    cd devconf.cz-edge-automation
    ./configure-demo.sh
